//store will be working as a container to hold initial states and logic to update the reducers
//store objects come from redux library
//combineReducers - is a hook used to combine multiple reducers as a single entity as redux will allow only one reducers per application
//getDefaultMiddleware - is a hook used to pass or inject some additional features like logger etc.in the execution cycle
//configureStore - is a hook used to pass intial state and the reducers 
//reducer - is a function which works with switch case (for each action type) and updates the state
// for every change returns new state
//each component will have its respective reducer 
//action - is the object a reducer accepts to create a new state
//action - object => action type (increment) ,payload (+5)


import { combineReducers } from "redux"; // to add logic for building data manipulations and creating new state
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'; // to create store and holds the state

import userReducer from "./User/UserReducer"; //importing user reducer


let rootReducer = combineReducers({
    userState : userReducer // adding user reducer to root reducer
});

//creating store and passing root reducer to it
let store = configureStore({
    reducer : rootReducer
});

export default store;
// Redux - the data management library for front-end applications (not just react)
// Reducers <callback functions - with switch case using action <type and payload>>
// Actions  <action object consists of <type and payload>>
// ActionCreator <can be understood as the event handler call from the front end>
// Dispatcher <creates a pipeline of multiple actions and takes them to store/reducer>
// Store <collection of reducers/states and acts as parent of all react app components so that states can be accessed via props>
