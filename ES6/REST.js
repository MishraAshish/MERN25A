// REST - Representational State Transfer protocol

// REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
// It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- typically HTTP.

// These are the API's or Services to do data transactions over HTTP
// These are also called as Endpoints, Microservices, or Web Services

// This becomes a service orientated architecture (SOA) where each service is responsible for a specific functionality.
// Data format is typically JSON or XML, but JSON is more common in modern applications.

// HTTP/s => Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure)

// HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations on resources.

// HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

// Specifications of RESTful APIs:
// 1. Use HTTP methods explicitly. - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
//    - GET: Retrieve data from the server.
//    - POST: Create a new resource on the server.
//    - PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
//    - PATCH: Partially update an existing resource on the server.
//    - DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
// 2. Use URIs to identify resources.
// 3. Use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of operations.
// 4. Use JSON or XML for data exchange.
// 5. Stateless communication - each request from client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
